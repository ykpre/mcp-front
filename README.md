An authentication gateway for [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers. Let your team use Claude with internal databases, APIs, and tools without exposing them to the internet.

## The problem

You want your team to use Claude with internal MCP servers (databases, Linear, Notion, internal APIs). But MCP servers don't have built-in multi-user authentication. You either expose them to the public internet, build authentication yourself, or run separate instances per user. None of these are great.

## The solution

mcp-front sits between Claude and your MCP servers as an authentication gateway. Your team authenticates via OAuth once (Google, Azure AD, GitHub, or any OIDC provider). When Claude connects, mcp-front validates the token, checks the user belongs to your organization, and proxies to the actual MCP server in your secure environment.

For stdio servers, each user gets an isolated subprocess. For services that need individual API keys (Notion, Linear), users connect them once through a web UI and mcp-front injects tokens automatically. Tokens are scoped to specific services ([RFC 8707](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8707)) — a token for your Postgres server won't work for Linear.

Organization-wide access control with per-user isolation. No modifications to your MCP servers. Nothing exposed to the internet.

## How it works

1. User adds `https://your-domain.com/<service>/sse` to Claude
2. Claude redirects to the identity provider for login (first time only)
3. mcp-front validates the user belongs to your organization
4. If the service needs a user API key (Notion, Linear), user connects it through a web page
5. mcp-front proxies all MCP requests to the backend server

## Try it locally

Save this as `config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "v0.0.1-DEV_EDITION_EXPECT_CHANGES",
  "proxy": {
    "baseURL": "http://localhost:8080",
    "addr": ":8080"
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "transportType": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"],
      "serviceAuths": [
        {
          "type": "bearer",
          "tokens": ["dev-token-123"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
# With Go
go install github.com/stainless-api/mcp-front/cmd/mcp-front@main
mcp-front -config config.json

# Or with Docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/config.json:/app/config.json dgellow/mcp-front:latest
```

In Claude.ai, add an MCP server with URL `http://localhost:8080/filesystem/sse`, auth type Bearer Token, token `dev-token-123`.

See the **[Quickstart](https://stainless-api.github.io/mcp-front/quickstart/)** for a full walkthrough.

## Going further

**[Identity Providers](https://stainless-api.github.io/mcp-front/identity-providers/)** — Set up Google, Azure AD, GitHub, or any OIDC provider for production OAuth.

**[Configuration](https://stainless-api.github.io/mcp-front/configuration/)** — All config options including Firestore persistence, HTTPS, and per-user service authentication.

**[Server Types](https://stainless-api.github.io/mcp-front/server-types/)** — Stdio, SSE, streamable HTTP, inline tools, and aggregate endpoints.

**[Service Authentication](https://stainless-api.github.io/mcp-front/service-authentication/)** — Per-user tokens for services like Notion, Linear, and other OAuth or API key services.

### Backends behind Cloud Run IAM

For `sse` and `streamable-http` backends protected by Google Cloud IAM (e.g. a
Cloud Run service deployed with `--no-allow-unauthenticated`), set
`googleIDTokenAudience` to the backend's audience (usually its service URL).
mcp-front then mints Google-signed ID tokens from its runtime service account
and sends them as the `Authorization` header — no static tokens to manage, and
the backend needs no auth code at all:

```json
"my-backend": {
  "transportType": "streamable-http",
  "url": "https://my-backend-abc123-uc.a.run.app/mcp",
  "googleIDTokenAudience": "https://my-backend-abc123-uc.a.run.app"
}
```

Grant `roles/run.invoker` on the backend to mcp-front's service account.

If the backend also needs a static `Authorization` header for its own
application-level auth, configure both: the ID token is then sent in
`X-Serverless-Authorization` (which Cloud Run validates and strips) and the
static header passes through untouched.

**[Architecture](https://stainless-api.github.io/mcp-front/architecture/)** — Per-service audience validation, token flow, and MCP spec compliance.

**[API Reference](https://stainless-api.github.io/mcp-front/api-reference/)** — HTTP endpoints, OAuth discovery, and client registration.

## Security

mcp-front uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for public clients, domain and organization-based access control, per-user session isolation for stdio servers, per-service audience claims ([RFC 8707](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8707)) to prevent token reuse across services, and AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data at rest.

**Security boundary**: mcp-front handles authentication. MCP servers handle authorization and input validation. Only use MCP servers you trust with your data.
